# Using SPWN as a "trigger language"

Ok, first off, what is SPWN even used for?

> **SPWN has two main usecases:**
>
> - Compiling readable code to Geometry Dash triggers
> - Programmatically building levels, or doing tedious/repetitive tasks in the editor

In this first part of the introduction, we will cover the first use case.

So, in this use case, you can think of your code as the source code for the triggers in your level.
If you don't understand this yet, don't worry. We will get on to examples of SPWN in action soon.

_**Note:** This introduction assumes you have some understanding of basic programming concepts, and basic understanding of Geometry Dash triggers_
