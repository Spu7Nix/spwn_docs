# Script Assisted Building

Now that you have the power to make complicated trigger machines in Geometry Dash relatively easily, we can now move on to learn how to make things other than triggers using SPWN. Up until now, much of the SPWN code we have been writing has been code that will be "executed" while the level runs, or at _runtime_. However, when building things other than triggers using SPWN, pretty much all of the code will be executed while the code compiles, or at _compiletime_.

First, we will be learning about how to actually place and deal with Geometry Dash objects in SPWN: [**Next page**](scriptassistedbuilding/1object_values.md).
